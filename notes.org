* Dependencies
** erlang modules
   erlsha2
** external programs
   imagemagick

* To Dos
  
** TODO should remember name and tripcode when starting a thread
   probably SHOULDN'T keep this in session state 'cause it might cause
   counterintuitive behavior when someone's speaking on multiple threads
** TODO should highlight/animate new messages
** TODO lay out messages a bit more compactly (maybe reduce preview size to 200 or so)
** TODO do something intelligent with input newlines, rather than just dropping them
** TODO JS-based tripcode comparison
** TODO dynamic front page (update latest messages to threads and reorder them properly)
