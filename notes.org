** DONE should remember name and tripcode when starting a thread
   CLOSED: [2012-07-23 Mon 22:03]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2012-07-23 Mon 22:04] \\
     -System now records your username and tripcode when you start a new thread. 
     It may actually be better to do it on each comment post
   - probably SHOULDN'T keep this in session state 'cause it might cause
     counterintuitive behavior when someone's speaking on multiple threads
   - actually, now that I think about it, session state isn't a bad idea for this.
     the only way it could bite you is if you're simultaneously starting multiple threads
     and want to have a different name/trip in each one
** DONE should highlight/animate new messages
   CLOSED: [2012-07-23 Mon 22:17]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2012-07-23 Mon 22:18] \\
     -New comments are now highlighted as they're posted
   This is going to require dicking around with Nitrogen paths
** DONE lay out messages a bit more compactly (maybe reduce preview size to 200 or so)
   CLOSED: [2012-07-23 Mon 21:24]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2012-07-23 Mon 21:25] \\
     -Image preview size is now 250, max image size is 2MB (may reduce that based on traffic)
     -Line height and padding have been blown away on individual comments
** DONE do something intelligent with input newlines, rather than just dropping them
   CLOSED: [2012-07-23 Mon 17:54]
** DONE JS-based tripcode comparison
   CLOSED: [2012-07-23 Mon 21:48]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2012-07-23 Mon 21:49] \\
     Mousing over a tripcode now highlights all instances of the same tripcode
** DONE dynamic front page (update latest messages to threads and reorder them properly)
   CLOSED: [2012-07-23 Mon 23:21]

     Done. That's going to be spawning processes and calls straight out the ass, but done and working nicely.
  
** TODO Limit comment size in some way
   - Preview should have a cap of ~200 characters. In fact, it should probably
     do something like take the first non-empty parsed line of the message and preview the
     first 200 characters of that.
   - Full comment should have a much higher, but finite limit (more like ~5K than ~200)
** DONE Limit field size to some semi-reasonable character count
   CLOSED: [2012-07-24 Tue 00:18]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2012-07-24 Tue 00:18] \\
     Done
   - Really don't know why I'd go lower than 100 characters or so for either tripcode or username
   - Consider doing ~100 for username and ~250 for tripcode
** TODO Chan-style tripcodes (no separate field, substring the username)
   If you go this way, limit that new multi-purpose field to ~250 total
   Not entirely sure it's a good idea, though
** DONE Have a default username set by board, and use that if the user doesn't enter one
   CLOSED: [2012-07-27 Fri 17:10]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2012-07-27 Fri 17:11] \\
     Check. The default default_name is "Anonymous".
** TODO Hook up auth and set up a moderation system
   Mods should be able to 
*** TODO delete pictures
*** TODO delete comments
*** TODO delete threads
*** TODO move threads to different boards
*** TODO start new boards
*** TODO protect threads in some pre-emptive way. Not sure how yet, so no-op this one for now
       - force captcha?
       - force login?
       - force posting delay?
** DONE Change the echo functions to elements
   CLOSED: [2012-07-30 Mon 10:53]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2012-07-30 Mon 10:54] \\
     -Done. Instead of having echo functions, we now have element records and associated rendering functions.
     -The more comlex elements have a from_tup/1 function which takes model output and renders the appropriate element
** TODO Change some of the event functions into actions
** TODO Create custom form element/behavior to avoid the event finangling with the default nitrogen upload
** TODO Add description and deleted image for boards
   Fields added, still need to hook them up properly
** DONE Add a way to delete images/comments/threads/boards
   CLOSED: [2012-07-30 Mon 16:51]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2012-07-30 Mon 16:53] \\
     - Threads, comments and images are now deletable (though not undeletable, and never will be)
     - Boards can't be deleted, the point of the deletion elements is going to be limiting spam and idiocy, and I can't see an entire board getting to the point that it needs to go
** TODO Check whether the thread is active before displaying certain things
   The reply button shouldn't be shown for a dead thread
** TODO Separate summarize/1 into two functions
   One that deals with converting records to tuples (to_tup/1)
   One that deals with outputting summary data (summarize/1)
** DONE Re-write the database interactions in boards.erl to use the db: package more effectively (common is already a dependency)
   CLOSED: [2012-07-30 Mon 16:50]
   - CLOSING NOTE [2012-07-30 Mon 16:50] \\
     Done.
